My name is Tarcisio Sapucaia and I have less than 3 years of experience as a developer. I'm living in Brazil and studying civil engineering, but I've always been passionate about programming where I sometimes venture. My idea is to be able to work with both areas, who knows how to be a programmer of specific software for civil engineering.
