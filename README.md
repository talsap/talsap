### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tarcisio Sapucaia and I have less than 3 years of experience as a developer. I'm living in Brazil and studying civil engineering, but I've always been passionate about programming where I sometimes venture. My idea is to be able to work with both areas, who knows how to be a programmer of specific software for civil engineering.

- ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m have a degree in exact sciences at [UFRB](https://ufrb.edu.br/portal/)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on [EDP](https://github.com/talsap/edp) software development 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ðŸ‘‡
